# Granny's Crossword Puzzle Game

Welcome! This is a rather short game that was developed in Python 3.13 using Pygame and other modules.
You're free to download and play the game, if you want.  No install is required if you're using the "dist\" folder.

## What's Included

- PNG files created using Aesprite
- .EXE file to launch the game.
- "Sprite Coder" font - (dafont.com)

## How to play

- Download the "dist\" folder and store it somewhere easy to find. I prefer desktop.
- The .exe file will launch the game, ONLY if you have all other assets in the same folder (.png's, etc)

## Permissions & Use

- You're welcome to download and play the game.
- Please **do not reuse, modify, or redistribute the code or assets** without my permission.
- If you'd like to contribute, collaborate, or ask questions, feel free to reach out!

## Credits

- Game code and design: Daniel Morton
- Secondary tools for design: Piskel, Aesprite, and sometimes GIMP
- Built with: Python 3.13 and Pygame.
